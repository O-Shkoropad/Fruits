                    <h4>Higher antioxidant levels</h4>

                    <p>    Blueberries are one of the best natural sources of antioxidants.
                        While antioxidants aren’t necessary for your body to function, they
                        help protect your body from damage by free radicals. Your cells produce
                        free radicals as waste products, but these particles can go on to hurt other cells.
                        Eating blueberries regularly for just two weeks can help reduce damage to your cells
                        by as much as 20%. </p>

                                    <h4>How to Prepare Blueberries</h4>

                                    <p>Blueberries are native to temperate parts of North America.
                                        They are traditionally in season from April to September in the US,
                                        but are sold year-round as imports from South America.
                                        These tasty berries can be found in supermarkets, health food stores,
                                        and farmers’ markets around the country.
                                        Blueberries bring a mild, sweet flavor that’s perfect for baked goods
                                        and desserts. You can also enjoy raw blueberries by themselves as simple
                                        healthy snacks. Blueberries last longer if they’re refrigerated or frozen,
                                        and they can be added in fresh or frozen form to most recipes with similar results.
                                        Here are some suggestions for how to add blueberries to your daily diet:

                    <h4>What Is a Plum?</h4>
                    <p>Who are you calling a drupe? The plum, that's who. A drupe is a fruit that has seeds surrounded
                        by rock-like pits. That explains plums' other classification: stone fruit.

                        Plums belong to the same family as peaches, nectarines, and apricots. But plums are much more
                        diverse than their stone-fruit cousins. They can be large or small, with red, purple, green,
                        yellow, or orange skin, and pink, yellow, or orange flesh.

                        They first grew in China thousands of years ago. Then plums made their way to Japan, parts of
                        Europe, and America. Today, more than 2,000 varieties grow all over the world.

                        Plums add subtle sweetness to salads and desserts, but their health benefits are the juiciest
                        part of the package.</p>

                                    <h4>Plum Health Benefits</h4>
                                  <p> The vitamin C in plums helps your body heal, build muscle, and form blood vessels.
                                      It's great for your eyes, too.
                                      Here are other ways that plums are good for your health:</p>
                                      <ul>
                                      <li>Heart disease.  Phytochemicals and nutrients in plums lower the inflammation that triggers heart disease.</li>
                                    <li>Anxiety. A plum a day may keep anxiety away. When your antioxidants are low, anxiety can be high.</li>
                                    <li>Constipation Relief. Plums, like prunes, can also help keep things moving through your system. They have a lot of sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that acts as a natural laxative.</li>
                                      <li>High blood pressure and stroke. The potassium in plums is good for blood pressure control in two ways. It helps your body get rid of sodium when you pee, and it lessens tension in
                                          the walls of your blood vessels. When your blood pressure is lower, your odds of getting a stroke go down.</li>
                                      <li>Rich in antioxidants. These substances protect the body against the cell and tissue damage that can lead to
                                          diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer.</li>
                                      <li>Reduce blood sugar. Plums are chock full of fiber, which helps slow down a blood sugar spike after you eat carbs.
                                          They can also boost your body’s production of adiponectin, a hormone that helps regulate your blood sugar levels.</li>
                                    <li>Bone health. Research on animals shows prunes (dried plums) may help reduce bone loss, and may even reverse it.</li>

                                    <h4>Plum Preparation</h4>
                                    <p>You'll find plums in the grocery store and at farmers markets from May to October,
                                        though their peak season is July to August.
                                        Look for firm plums that have a slight "give" when you squeeze them gently.
                                        If your plum ripens before you're ready to eat it, put it in the fridge.
                                        If you need it to ripen quickly, keep your plum in a paper bag at room
                                        temperature overnight or up to 3 days.</p>
