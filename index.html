                    <p>    Blueberries are one of the best natural sources of antioxidants.
                        While antioxidants aren’t necessary for your body to function, they
                        help protect your body from damage by free radicals. Your cells produce
                        free radicals as waste products, but these particles can go on to hurt other cells.
                        Eating blueberries regularly for just two weeks can help reduce damage to your cells
                        by as much as 20%. </p>

                            <h4>How to Prepare Blueberries</h4>

                            <p>Blueberries are native to temperate parts of North America.
                                They are traditionally in season from April to September in the US,
                                but are sold year-round as imports from South America.
                                These tasty berries can be found in supermarkets, health food stores,
                                and farmers’ markets around the country.
                                Blueberries bring a mild, sweet flavor that’s perfect for baked goods
                                and desserts. You can also enjoy raw blueberries by themselves as simple
                                healthy snacks. Blueberries last longer if they’re refrigerated or frozen,
                                and they can be added in fresh or frozen form to most recipes with similar results.
                                Here are some suggestions for how to add blueberries to your daily diet:

                    <h4>What Is a Plum?</h4>
                    <p>Who are you calling a drupe? The plum, that's who. A drupe is a fruit that has seeds surrounded
                        by rock-like pits. That explains plums' other classification: stone fruit.

                        Plums belong to the same family as peaches, nectarines, and apricots. But plums are much more
                        diverse than their stone-fruit cousins. They can be large or small, with red, purple, green,
                        yellow, or orange skin, and pink, yellow, or orange flesh.

                        They first grew in China thousands of years ago. Then plums made their way to Japan, parts of
                        Europe, and America. Today, more than 2,000 varieties grow all over the world.

                        Plums add subtle sweetness to salads and desserts, but their health benefits are the juiciest
                        part of the package.</p>

                                    <h4>Plum Health Benefits</h4>
                                  <p> The vitamin C in plums helps your body heal, build muscle, and form blood vessels.
                                      It's great for your eyes, too.
                                      Here are other ways that plums are good for your health:</p>
                                      <ul>
                                      <li>Heart disease.  Phytochemicals and nutrients in plums lower the inflammation
                                          that triggers heart disease.</li>
                                    <li>Anxiety. A plum a day may keep anxiety away.
                                        When your antioxidants are low, anxiety can be high.</li>
                                    <li>Constipation Relief. Plums, like prunes, can also help keep things moving
                                        through your system. They have a lot of sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that
                                        acts as a natural laxative.</li>
                                      <li>High blood pressure and stroke. The potassium in plums is good for blood
                                          pressure control in two ways. It helps your body get rid of sodium when you
                                          pee, and it lessens tension in
                                          the walls of your blood vessels. When your blood pressure is lower, your odds
                                          of getting a stroke go down.</li>
                                      <li>Rich in antioxidants. These substances protect the body against the cell and
                                          tissue damage that can lead to
                                          diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer.</li>
                                      <li>Reduce blood sugar. Plums are chock full of fiber, which helps slow down
                                          a blood sugar spike after you eat carbs.
                                          They can also boost your body’s production of adiponectin, a hormone that helps
                                          regulate your blood sugar levels.</li>
                                    <li>Bone health. Research on animals shows prunes (dried plums) may help reduce bone
                                        loss, and may even reverse it.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <p>You'll find plums in the grocery store and at farmers markets from May to October,
                                        though their peak season is July to August.
                                        Look for firm plums that have a slight "give" when you squeeze them gently.
                                        If your plum ripens before you're ready to eat it, put it in the fridge.
                                        If you need it to ripen quickly, keep your plum in a paper bag at room
                                        temperature overnight or up to 3 days.</p>

                                    <h4>What Is an Apple?</h4>
                                    <p>An apple is a crunchy, bright-colored fruit, one of the most popular in the
                                        United States. You’ve probably heard the age-old saying, “An apple a day keeps
                                        the doctor away.” Although eating apples isn’t a cure-all, it is good for your health.
                                        European settlers brought apples with them to the Americas.
                                        They preferred them to North America’s native crabapple, a small, tarter fruit.</p>

                                                    <h4>Plum Health Benefits</h4>
                                                    <p>Apples can do a lot for you, thanks to plant chemicals called flavonoids.
                                                        And they have pectin, a fiber that breaks
                                                        down in your gut. If you take off the apple’s skin before eating
                                                        it, you won’t get as much of the fiber or flavonoids.
                                                        The fiber can slow digestion so you feel fuller after eating.
                                                        This can keep you from overeating. Eating fiber-rich foods helps
                                                        control symptoms and lessens the effects of acid reflux.
                                                        An apple’s fiber can also help with diarrhea and constipation.
                                                        Some studies show that plant chemicals and the fiber of an apple
                                                        peel protect against blood vessel and heart damage. They also can
                                                        help lower your cholesterol, and they might protect your cells’ DNA
                                                        from something called oxidative damage, which is one of the things
                                                        that can lead to cancer.
                                                        Research shows the antioxidants in apples can slow the growth of
                                                        cancer cells. And they can protect the cells in your pancreas,
                                                        which can lower your chances of type 2 diabetes.

                                                    <p>When you’re buying apples, make sure they feel firm and heavy.
                                                        The skin shouldn’t have bruises, cuts, or soft spots.
                                                        Make sure to store apples in your refrigerator to keep them fresh
                                                        longer. They can be stored at room temperature, but they’ll ripen
                                                        much faster.
                                                        When you eat an apple, leave the skin on because it has more than
