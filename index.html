                    <h4>Higher antioxidant levels</h4>

                    <p>    Blueberries are one of the best natural sources of antioxidants.
                        While antioxidants aren’t necessary for your body to function, they
                        help protect your body from damage by free radicals. Your cells produce
                        free radicals as waste products, but these particles can go on to hurt other cells.
                        Eating blueberries regularly for just two weeks can help reduce damage to your cells
                        by as much as 20%. </p>

                            <h4>How to Prepare Blueberries</h4>

                            <p>Blueberries are native to temperate parts of North America.
                                They are traditionally in season from April to September in the US,
                                but are sold year-round as imports from South America.
                                These tasty berries can be found in supermarkets, health food stores,
                                and farmers’ markets around the country.
                                Blueberries bring a mild, sweet flavor that’s perfect for baked goods
                                and desserts. You can also enjoy raw blueberries by themselves as simple
                                healthy snacks. Blueberries last longer if they’re refrigerated or frozen,
                                and they can be added in fresh or frozen form to most recipes with similar results.
                                Here are some suggestions for how to add blueberries to your daily diet:

                    <h4>What Is a Plum?</h4>
                    <p>Who are you calling a drupe? The plum, that's who. A drupe is a fruit that has seeds surrounded
                        by rock-like pits. That explains plums' other classification: stone fruit.

                        Plums belong to the same family as peaches, nectarines, and apricots. But plums are much more
                        diverse than their stone-fruit cousins. They can be large or small, with red, purple, green,
                        yellow, or orange skin, and pink, yellow, or orange flesh.

                        They first grew in China thousands of years ago. Then plums made their way to Japan, parts of
                        Europe, and America. Today, more than 2,000 varieties grow all over the world.

                                    <h4>Plum Health Benefits</h4>
                                  <p> The vitamin C in plums helps your body heal, build muscle, and form blood vessels.
                                      It's great for your eyes, too.
                                      Here are other ways that plums are good for your health:</p>
                                      <ul>
                                      <li>Heart disease.  Phytochemicals and nutrients in plums lower the inflammation
                                          that triggers heart disease.</li>
                                    <li>Anxiety. A plum a day may keep anxiety away.
                                        When your antioxidants are low, anxiety can be high.</li>
                                    <li>Constipation Relief. Plums, like prunes, can also help keep things moving
                                        through your system. They have a lot of sorbitol, a sugar alcohol that
                                        acts as a natural laxative.</li>
                                      <li>High blood pressure and stroke. The potassium in plums is good for blood
                                          pressure control in two ways. It helps your body get rid of sodium when you
                                          pee, and it lessens tension in
                                          the walls of your blood vessels. When your blood pressure is lower, your odds
                                          of getting a stroke go down.</li>
                                      <li>Rich in antioxidants. These substances protect the body against the cell and
                                          tissue damage that can lead to
                                          diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cancer.</li>
                                      <li>Reduce blood sugar. Plums are chock full of fiber, which helps slow down
                                          a blood sugar spike after you eat carbs.
                                          They can also boost your body’s production of adiponectin, a hormone that helps
                                          regulate your blood sugar levels.</li>
                                    <li>Bone health. Research on animals shows prunes (dried plums) may help reduce bone
                                        loss, and may even reverse it.</li>

                                    <p>You'll find plums in the grocery store and at farmers markets from May to October,
                                        though their peak season is July to August.
                                        Look for firm plums that have a slight "give" when you squeeze them gently.
                                        If your plum ripens before you're ready to eat it, put it in the fridge.
                                        If you need it to ripen quickly, keep your plum in a paper bag at room
                                        temperature overnight or up to 3 days.</p>

                                    <h4>What Is an Apple?</h4>
                                    <p>An apple is a crunchy, bright-colored fruit, one of the most popular in the
                                        United States. You’ve probably heard the age-old saying, “An apple a day keeps
                                        the doctor away.” Although eating apples isn’t a cure-all, it is good for your health.
                                        European settlers brought apples with them to the Americas.
                                        They preferred them to North America’s native crabapple, a small, tarter fruit.</p>

                                                    <h4>Plum Health Benefits</h4>
                                                    <p>Apples can do a lot for you, thanks to plant chemicals called flavonoids.
                                                        And they have pectin, a fiber that breaks
                                                        down in your gut. If you take off the apple’s skin before eating
                                                        it, you won’t get as much of the fiber or flavonoids.
                                                        The fiber can slow digestion so you feel fuller after eating.
                                                        This can keep you from overeating. Eating fiber-rich foods helps
                                                        control symptoms and lessens the effects of acid reflux.
                                                        An apple’s fiber can also help with diarrhea and constipation.
                                                        Some studies show that plant chemicals and the fiber of an apple
                                                        peel protect against blood vessel and heart damage. They also can
                                                        help lower your cholesterol, and they might protect your cells’ DNA
                                                        from something called oxidative damage, which is one of the things
                                                        that can lead to cancer.
                                                        Research shows the antioxidants in apples can slow the growth of
                                                        cancer cells. And they can protect the cells in your pancreas,
                                                        which can lower your chances of type 2 diabetes.

                                                    <h4>How to Buy and Prepare Apples</h4>
                                                    <p>When you’re buying apples, make sure they feel firm and heavy.
                                                        The skin shouldn’t have bruises, cuts, or soft spots.
                                                        Make sure to store apples in your refrigerator to keep them fresh
                                                        longer. They can be stored at room temperature, but they’ll ripen
                                                        much faster.
                                                        When you eat an apple, leave the skin on because it has more than

        <h2>Get the Health Benefits of Fruit</h2>
        <h4>Fruit Won't Make You Fat</h4>
        <p>Because fruit contains natural sugars, many widely followed diet plans recommend avoiding
        it or at least severely limiting it. But the sugars in cantaloupe or peaches, say, don’t have
        the same negative effects on the body as high-fructose corn syrup of other types of sugars added to foods.<br>
        “Although the natural sugar in fruit is chemically similar to table sugar, our bodies process whole fruit
        differently because of the fiber, phytochemicals, and micronutrients,” says Hannah Meier, R.D., research
        associate at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston.
        “Fiber slows the rate that the natural sugars are released into the bloodstream, preventing the spikes and
            crashes that might otherwise be experienced after eating a sugary treat.”</p><br>
        <h4>Even people with diabetes should eat fruit.</h4>

      <p>  “We tell diabetics to be mindful of portion sizes of fruit and count them as part of their carbohydrate intake,”
        Hunnes says. “But overly limiting fruit is dangerous because you’re cutting out vitamins, minerals, fiber, and
          extra water you could be getting in your diet.”</p>
    <h2>Fruit Is Packed With Nutrients</h2>
    <p>When it comes to nutritional bang for your buck, fruit is hard to beat.<br>

    “All fruits are high in fiber and potassium, and most are also good sources of vitamins A and C, folate, and a wide
    variety of phytochemicals,” says Nicola M. McKeown, Ph.D., a nutritional epidemiologist at Tufts.<br>

    Phyto­chemicals such as anthocyanins and other flavonoids, which are potent antioxidants, may have a variety of
    benefits, including better heart and brain health and a reduced risk of cancer.<br>

    According to the Department of Agriculture, when fruit is consumed in the recommended amounts, it contributes
    16 percent of our recommended fiber intake and 17 percent of our potassium. Typical American diets are low in
    these nutrients.<br>
    Frozen fruit is as nutritious as fresh, provided it contains no added sugars. Same goes for canned fruit—look forthose
        packed in their own juice, not sugar-laden syrup. Fiber helps you maintain a healthy weight, can improve cholesterol
        levels, and keeps your digestive system running smoothly.</p>
            <h2>It's Good for Your Heart</h2>
            <p>“Obesity and high blood pressure are the two main risk factors for heart disease,” Rimm says.
                “And fruit intake has been linked to lowering the risk of both. For example, trials have shown that you
                can get a 20 to 25 percent reduction in risk of heart disease by replacing two servings of starchy
                vegetables or refined carbo­hydrates with two servings of fruit a day.”<br>
                The potassium in fruit helps account for the strong association between increased fruit intake and
                a lower risk of high blood pressure.<br>
                But it’s not just one nutrient in fruit that makes a difference. Anthocyanins reduced the risk
                of hypertension by 8 to 12 percent in people who consumed the most in a 14-year study published
                in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.<br>
                These compounds have been shown to ­improve vascular function—reducing inflam­ma­tion in the vessels
                and improving blood flow. And the impact of increasing your fruit ­intake on blood pressure can be quick.
                “In some of our research, we’ve seen reduc­tions within three months of dietary change,” Rimm says.
